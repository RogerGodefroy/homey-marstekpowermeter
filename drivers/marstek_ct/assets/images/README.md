# Driver Images

This directory should contain the following image files for the driver:

- `small.png` - 75x75 pixels (for device lists)
- `large.png` - 500x500 pixels (for device details)
- `xlarge.png` - 1000x1000 pixels (for device details in larger views)

These images should represent the Marstek CT Smart Meter device.

You can create these images using any image editor. Make sure they have transparent backgrounds for best results.
